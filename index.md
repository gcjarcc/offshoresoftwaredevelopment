We recommend that unit testing should be planned and accomplished by the developers. Integration testing involves testing the combinations of program units and their interfaces. Integration testing should be planned during the design phase and accomplished with an appropriate balance of developers with design knowledge and independent testers with minimal design biases. Systems testing should involve testing the entire system to verify that system requirements are met including specified functions, quality, and performance characteristics. System testing should be planned during requirement analysis and accomplished by independent testers. Acceptance testing involves testing the system to ensure that it is ready for delivery and use.
